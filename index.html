    <h1>Cycling & Its Benefits</h1>

    <p>
      When most people in the United States thing of a cyclist they typically
      picture a young, to middle aged fit person in full cycling gear with an
      expensive bike that takes up too much space on the road. If you asked a
      dutch person to describe a cyclist, their response could range from a
      child on their way to school, an older person coming back from a trip to
      the grocery store, or just anyone making their regular commute. This
      difference in mentality comes from the way cycling is treated in these two
      places.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the United states, most places do not have infrastructure built to
      encourage the use of bicycles. This means that cyclists are typically
      forced to either take up space on the road (which drivers absolutely hate)
      or if they're lucky, have to use what is typically called a "painted
      bicycle gutter". A painted bicycle gutter is the laziest way for a city to
      create bicycle infrastructure. It is basically just painting off a small
      portion.

        <h2>Cycling in NA vs. Netherlands</h2>
        <p>
          When most people in the United States thing of a cyclist they
          typically picture a young, to middle aged fit person in full cycling
          gear with an expensive bike that takes up too much space on the road.
          If you asked a dutch person to describe a cyclist, their response
          could range from a child on their way to school, an older person
          coming back from a trip to the grocery store, or just anyone making

          In the United states, most places do not have infrastructure built to
          encourage the use of bicycles. This means that cyclists are typically
          forced to either take up space on the road (which drivers absolutely
          hate) or if they're lucky, have to use what is typically called a
          "painted bicycle gutter". A painted bicycle gutter is the laziest way
          for a city to create bicycle infrastructure. It is basically just
          painting off a small portion of a current road and "dedicating" it to
          bikes. These are obviously terrible because it allows cars to get very
          close to cyclists, which is extremely unsafe. On top of this, they are
          often blocked by parked vehicles and not maintained, which also makes
          them dangerous to the intended users.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other side of the coin, the Netherlands treats cycling as the
          primary mode of transportation for trips lasting around 5-15 minutes.
          This means that they have infrastructure in place that allows cyclists
          to safely and quickly reach their destinations, which leads to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_the_Netherlands"
            >36% of Dutch people</a
          >
          listing bicycle as their most frequent mode of transportation on a
          typical day.
        </p>

        <h2>What Does Good Cycling Infrastructure Look Like?</h2>

        <p>
          There are many different types of infrastructure that can make cycling
          preferable to driving, especially for short trips. For example, the
          employment of protected or separated bike lanes can make it much safer
          for cyclists to make trips alongside drivers, which is a win-win as
          more people cycling means less traffic.
